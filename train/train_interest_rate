FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, American Physician
Partners, Inc. ("BORROWER"), a Delaware corporation, hereby promises to pay to
the order of BT Capital Partners SBIC, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, or
its registered assigns (the "HOLDER"), the principal sum of TWENTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($20,000,000), on July 31, 2009 (the "MATURITY DATE"), with interest
payable thereon on the unpaid principal amount of this Note from time to time as
provided herein.

Interest. Borrower promises to pay interest (the
"INTEREST") on the principal amount of this Note, and on interest accrued but
not paid as provided in Section 1(d), at the rate of 8.0% per annum (as may be
adjusted pursuant to the immediately succeeding sentence, the "INTEREST RATE").
In the event that the Market Price Event has not occurred as of (i) the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Interest Rate shall automatically
increase to 8.25% per annum commencing with the third anniversary of the Closing
Date and (ii) the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Interest Rate shall automatically
increase to 8.50% per annum commencing with the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, once the Interest Rate has increased to 8.25%
or 8.50%, as the case may be, the Interest Rate shall remain the same and shall
not be decreased back to 8.00% or 8.25%, as the case may be. The Interest on
this Note shall accrue from and including the date of issuance through and until
repayment of the principal amount of this Note and payment of all Interest in
full, and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months, compounded quarterly. Interest shall be paid as follows:

Basic Interest. Except as set forth in Section 1(b) and
Section 1(d), Borrower shall pay Interest quarterly in arrears on each March 31,
June 30, September 30 and December 31, of each year or, if any such date shall
not be a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day to occur after such
date (each date upon which interest shall be so payable, an "INTEREST PAYMENT
DATE"). Interest shall accrue, be paid in PIK Securities (as hereinafter
defined) or be paid in cash in accordance with Section 1(d). If Interest is to
be paid in cash, then such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account at a bank designated in writing by the Holder. In
the absence of any such written designation, any such Interest payment shall be
deemed made on the date a check in the applicable amount payable to the order of
Holder is received by the Holder at its last address as reflected in Borrower's
note register; if no such address appears, then to such Holder in care of the
last address in such note register of any predecessor holder of this Note (or
its predecessor).

Interest Rate.

PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST.
Beginning  as of the date of this Note  first  written  above (the "Date of
Note") and continuing until the outstanding  principal  balance is paid in full,
interest will accrue at an annual rate of Eight Percent (8.0%). Interest will be
computed on a 365/360 day basis compounding monthly; that is in each month 1/360
of the Eight Percent (8.0%) annual  interest rate, will be multiplied by (a) the
sum of (i) the  outstanding  principal  balance  and (ii)  accumulated  interest
outstanding  as of the end of the prior month and (b) the actual  number of days
that the principal was outstanding in such month.

Interest Accrual Period. Beginning as of the Date of Note first written above and continuing  through October 1, 2002 (the "Interest  Accrual  Period"),
interest shall accrue at an annual rate of Eight Percent (8.0%),  compounding on
the last date of each calendar month as described above;  provided,  however, if
the Collateral  Agent commences any action (judicial or  extrajudicial)  against
any  collateral  held by it  pursuant  to the  terms  of the  Collateral  Agency
Agreement, then such interest as may thereafter accrue shall be payable monthly,
in arrears,  on or before the first day of each month thereafter.  If on October
1,  2002,  the  common  stock of  Goodrich  Petroleum  Corporation,  a  Delaware
Corporation  ("Goodrich-Delaware")  has a  closing  price of at least  $4.00 per
share,  as adjusted  pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof (the "First  Benchmark Stock
Price"),  then,  at  Borrower's  option the  Interest  Accrual  Period  shall be
extended  to  October  1, 2003  (the  "First  Extension  Option").  If  Borrower
exercised  the First  Extension  Option,  and if on October 1, 2003,  the common
stock of  Goodrich-Delaware  has a closing price of at least $5.00 per share, as
adjusted  pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof (the "Second  Benchmark  Stock Price"),
then, at Borrower's  option,  the Interest  Accrual  Period shall be extended to
October 1, 2004 (the "Second Extension Option").

Payment  of  Interest.  During the  Principal  Repayment  Period,  all
interest that accrues  beginning on the last day of the Interest  Accrual Period
(initially  October  1,  2002,  but as may be  adjusted  by the First  Extension
Option, or the Second Extension Option),  shall be paid monthly on the first day
of each of the following months during the Principal Repayment Period.

FIXED INTEREST RATE.

The interest  rate on this Note is Eight Percent  (8.0%) per annum,  or, if
lower, the maximum rate of interest allowed by applicable law.

Since it would be impractical or extremely difficult to fix Lender's actual
damages for  collecting  and  accounting  for a late payment,  if any payment to
Lender required herein is not paid on or before its due date, Borrower shall pay
to Lender an amount equal to five percent (5%) of any such late payment (but not
less than ten dollars ($10) nor more than two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250)).
